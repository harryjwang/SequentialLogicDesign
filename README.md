# SequentialLogicDesign
A follow-on to the Lab1 design, focusing on flip-flops, counters, or simple FSMs:

Device: Intel MAX 10 (10M08SAE144C8G), Top: LogicalStep_Lab2_top.

- Full compile artifacts (timing, fit, flow, assembler).

- Illustrates the step from combinational to state-based FPGA designs.

-- Note: Lab2.zip also contains a copy of Lab1 (same top and device), likely for reference/continuity.
